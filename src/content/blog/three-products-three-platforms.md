I want to ship two things before the year ends: an iOS app and something with hardware. I've never done either.

## The Problem

I've been building web apps for years. It's gotten too easy. I miss the feeling of having no idea what I'm doing, googling basic syntax, and being genuinely surprised when something works.

## What I'm Building

**iOS**: Something native in Swift. Not a web view wrapped in an app. Actual iOS development with Xcode, SwiftUI, the whole thing. I don't even own a Mac yet.

**Hardware**: Probably starting with an Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Maybe a desk toy that responds to commits, or a physical dashboard for something. I honestly don't know what's possible yet.

## Why These Two

They're about as far from web development as I can get while still programming. Different constraints, different tools, different ways of thinking. Plus, I've always been curious about how iOS apps achieve that smooth feel, and hardware just seems fun.

## The Plan

No elaborate learning path. Just pick a simple idea and start building. When I get stuck, figure it out. Ship something small that works, even if it's basic.

I'll write about what I learn here â€“ mostly for my own reference when I inevitably forget how to configure Xcode or wire up an LED.

Three and a half months to go. We'll see how this goes.
