Note-taking has always felt slippery to me. Ideas land in half-finished drafts, todo lists live everywhere, and the moment I need a past thought it is buried three folders deep. The hard part is rarely capturing the note—it's grooming, connecting, and revisiting what I already wrote.

Recently I pulled two threads together: file-first note apps and AI assistants that run from the terminal. The combo has made maintaining my vault feel less like a chore and more like a routine I can stick with.

## Start with files you control

Steph Ango, Obsidian's CEO, talks about the power of "file over app"—your work should live in portable files, not a hosted database. Obsidian embraces that idea: it is markdown files in folders, nothing more. When the notes are just files, any tool that speaks markdown can help.

## Terminal agents speak the same language

Agents like Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and a wave of new CLI helpers work directly with the filesystem. They can read, diff, and edit local files the same way we do. Instead of a chatbot trapped in a browser tab, the assistant sits alongside your shell workflow.

Because both sides speak files, they naturally fit together: Obsidian (or any markdown-first app) manages the vault, while the agent brings structured help when I ask for it.

## My vault workflow

1. **Keep everything in plain markdown.** I store notes in an `obsidian/` vault, but the approach works with any folder of `.md` files.
2. **Open a terminal agent inside that vault.** `cd ~/notes` followed by `codex` or `claude` drops the assistant into context. It instantly understands the folder structure and file contents.
3. **Use lightweight commands as guardrails.** Most agents support custom prompts—slash commands in Claude Code, recipes in Codex, macros elsewhere. I keep them in a `/commands` directory so the agent can reuse them.
4. **Ask for focused help.** I lean on the agent for repetitive organization, not for writing finished prose. It makes suggestions, links files, and summarizes, but I stay in control.

## Commands that stick

These are the prompts that turned note maintenance from a weekly guilt trip into something sustainable:

- `/today` builds a daily note from a plain list of tasks, grouping them by project and linking to relevant docs.
- `/connections` scans the vault for related topics and proposes backlinks so the graph stays connected.
- `/sweep` finds stale notes—things I have not touched in ninety days—and drafts a quick summary so I can decide whether to archive or expand them.

Each command is just a small markdown file describing the job, the tone, and any folder rules. Because the assistant reads those files, it stays consistent without me rewriting the full prompt every time.

## Why it works

- **Less switching.** I stay in the editor and terminal I already use.
- **Lower friction.** When cleanup is a conversation instead of a blank page, I actually do it.
- **Portability.** If a new agent ships tomorrow, I point it at the same vault and reuse the prompts.

The result is not a perfectly automated system—it's still my messy brain—but the agent keeps the mess in motion. Notes feel alive again, and the daily sweep takes minutes instead of hours.

If note-taking feels like an endless backlog, try pairing a file-based vault with an AI terminal companion. Bring your own tools, keep your files close, and let the assistant shoulder the repetitive cleanup.
